Intro 2 boxes

Verse:
    Baby, baby, feel these sweet sensations... yeah
    Honey, honey, looks like a superstar, yeah yeah
    She got a promise of lovestruck fascination, ooh
    What am I to do? How am I to know who you are?

Chorus:
    When this love fool, osophy is killing previous illusions that
    I had in my mind about you
    Seems so true, all the lies you're telling tragically compelling and
    My love, it means nothing to you So maybe I'm still a love fool

Verse:
    She shimmers like a California sunset
    Lady lady, glitters but there's no gold
    She carries sweetly infectious magic formulas
    I'm so delirious, is she that serious? Or is she bringing me on? I've been waiting so long
