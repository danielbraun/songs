Feelin' better, now that we're through
Feelin' better, cause I'm over you
I've learned my lesson, it left a scar
Now I see how you really are

You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good (I'm gonna say it again)
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good

I broke a heart, that's gentle and true
Well, I broke a heart over someone like you
I'll beg his forgiveness on bended knee
I wouldn't blame him if he said to me

You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good (I'm gonna say it again)
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good

[Musical Interlude]

I'm telling you now baby, that I'm goin' my way
Forget about me baby, 'cause I'm leaving this day

You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good (I'm gonna say it again)
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good
Oh, oh, no
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good
