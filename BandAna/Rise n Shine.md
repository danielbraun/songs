Dawn wakes the silence of a fainted lullaby
Day breaks the eyelid from a song sung in my eye
Night rests in peace as the sun mourns the sky
And all is accounted for sheep, over a horizon I

Rise, rise 'n shine
A new day is coming
Rise, rise in time
For every thing's under the sun

And when you see a south wind blow
Forecasting, you will know
A hot day, will be on the way
(Foolish one)
You analyze the earth and the sky
I ask you why you can't analyze the signs
Of the present time

I had a dream, not unlike the one from old
Of a man king, whose head was made of gold
Stand castles of sand
Weather sundials rise 'n fall
Chasing wind through your hands
'Til water runs dry the well

Dream, Daniel dream
For what's yet to come
See, Daniel see
For every thing's under the sun

And in the west, a cloud appears
For shadows of a coming shower near
Oh, so near
(Hypocrites)
You analyze the earth and the sky
I ask you why you can't analyze the signs
Of the present time?

Vanity
Yes, all is vanity
Vanity
Yes, all is futility

For one that dies, another's born
Where laughter's heard, comforters mourn
There's a time for everything
A song for love, even abhor
An olive branch or a winter's war
There's a time for everything
Under the sun
Under the sun
Rise, rise 'n shine
A new day is coming
Rise, rise in time
For every thing's under the sun

(Rise) A new day is coming
When there's the time for everything under the sun
You know a time for everything under the sun
Because a new day is gonna be begun

Sun
