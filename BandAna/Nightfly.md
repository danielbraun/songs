I'm Lester the Nightfly
Hello Baton Rouge
Won't you turn your radio down
Respect the seven second delay we use

So you say there's a race of men in the trees
You're for tough legislation
Thanks for calling
I wait all night for calls like these

An independent station, WJAZ
With jazz and conversation from the foot of Mt. Belzoni
Sweet music, tonight the night is mine
Late line till the sun comes through the skylight

I've got plenty of java and Chesterfield Kings
But I feel like crying
I wish I had a heart of ice
A heart like ice

If you want your honey to look super swell
You must spring for that little blue jar
Patton's Kiss and Tell
Kiss and Tell

An independent station, WJAZ
With jazz and conversation from the foot of Mt. Belzoni
Sweet music, tonight the night is mine
Late line till the sun comes through the skylight

You'd never believe it, but once there was a time
When love was in my life
I sometimes wonder what happened to that flame
The answer's still the same
It was you, you
It was you
Tonight you're still on my mind

An independent station, WJAZ
With jazz and conversation from the foot of Mt. Belzoni
Sweet music, tonight the night is mine
Late line till the sun comes through the skyline
