I've been wandering around the house all night
Wondering what the hell to do
Yeah, I'm trying to concentrate but
All I can think of is you

Well the phone don't ring 'cause my friends ain't home
I'm tired of being all alone
Got the TV on 'cause the radio's playing
Songs that remind me of you

Baby, when you're gone
I realize I'm in love
Days go on and on
And the nights just seem so long
Even food don't taste that good
Drink ain't doing what it should
Things just feel so wrong
Baby, when you're gone
Yeah

I've been driving up and down these streets
Trying to find somewhere to go
Yeah, I'm looking for a familiar face
But there's no one I know

Oh, this is torture
This is pain
It feels like I'm gonna go insane
I hope you're coming back real soon
'Cause I don't know what to do

Baby, when you're gone
I realize I'm in love
Days go on and on
And the nights just seem so long
Even food don't taste that good
Drink ain't doing what it should
Things just feel so wrong
Yeah, baby, when you're gone

(Hey, don't go, Bryan, don't go
Yeah, when you're gone, babe
Don't go, don't go
Woo
Where are you, baby?)

Oh baby, when you're gone
I realize I'm in love
The days go on and on
And the nights just seem so long
Even food don't taste that good
Drink ain't doing what it should
Things just feel so wrong
Baby, when you're gone
Oh baby, when you're gone
Yeah, baby, when you're gone
