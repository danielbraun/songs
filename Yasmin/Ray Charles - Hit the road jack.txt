Woah Woman, oh woman, don't treat me so mean
You're the meanest old woman that I've ever seen
I guess if you said so
I'd have to pack my things and go (That's right)

Now baby, listen baby, don't ya treat me this-a way
Cause I'll be back on my feet some day
	(Don't care if you do 'cause it's understood)
	(You ain't got no money you just ain't no good)
Well, I guess if you say so
I'd have to pack my things and go (That's right)
