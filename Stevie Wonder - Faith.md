Lyrics:

    [Stevie Wonder:]
    See the girl with the diamonds in her shoes? Yeah
    She walks around like she's got nothing to lose
    Ya she's a go-getter, she's everybody's type
    She's a queen of the city but she don't believe the hype
    She's got her own elevation, holy motivation
    So I wrote some letters out in big bold type
    
    [Stevie Wonder & Ariana Grande:]
    I got faith in you baby, I got faith in you now
    And you've been sucha, sucha good friend to me
    Know that I love you somehow
    I met you, hallelujah, I got faith
    
    [Ariana Grande:]
    See the boy with the Stevie Wonder swag?
    Ain't got a clue, all the magic that he has
    He's a go-getter, he's everybody's type
    Gonna make it my mission, make him feel alright
    He's a twelve on a ten point, rockin' out to his joint
    Just say the word cause I could sing all night
    
    [Stevie Wonder & Ariana Grande:]
    I got faith in you baby, I got faith in you now
    And you've been sucha, sucha good friend to me
    Know that I love you somehow (love you somehow)
    I met you, hallelujah, I got faith
    
    Faith, yeah
    Yes I do, mmm
    I get around ya and my mind goes crazy
    I think about you mornin', noon, night and day
    I get around ya and my mind goes crazy
    I think about you mornin', noon, night and day
    I get around ya and my mind goes crazy (I got faith in you honey)
    I think about you mornin', noon, night and day (I got faith in you girl)
    I got faith in you honey, I got faith in you girl
    I met you, hallelujah
    
    I got faith in you baby, I got faith in you now
    And you've been sucha, sucha good friend to me
    Know that I love you somehow (love you somehow)
    I met you, hallelujah, I got faith
    (Faith, faith, baby)
    I got faith in you baby, I got faith in you now
    And you've been such a, such a good friend of me
    Know that I love you somehow
    I met you, hallelujah, I met you, hallelujah
    I met you, hallelujah, I got faith
