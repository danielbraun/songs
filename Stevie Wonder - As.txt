Lyrics:
  As around the sun:
    As Around The Sun The Earth Know She's Revolving
    And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
    Just as hate knows love's the cure, You can rest your mind assured
    that I'll be loving you always....
  As now can't reveal:
    As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
    But in passing will grow older everyday
    Just as all that's born is new, You know what I say is true
    That I'll be loving you always (1 missing bar)
  Short Chorus:
    Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky
    Until the ocean covers every mountain high
    Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4
    Until the day that is the day that are no more
  Did you know:
    Did you know that true love asks for nothing
    Her acceptance is the way we pay
    Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
    To last through forever and another day
  As today I know:
    As today I know I'm living but tomorrow
    Could make me the past, but that I mustn't fear
    I know deep in my mind, the love of me I've left behind
    Cause I'll be loving you always (1 missing bar)
  Full Chorus:
    Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
    Until the ocean covers every mountain high
    Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
    Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
    Until the day is night and night becomes the day
    Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
    Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4
    Until the day that is the day that are no more
