Chorus: 6 3 4 5 (Dm)

Verse:
    Little darlin' don't you see the sun is shining
    Just for you, only today
    If you hurry you can get a ray on you
    Come with me, just to play

Pre Chorus:
    Like every humming bird and bumblebee
    Every sunflower cloud and every tree
    I feel so much a part of this
     
    Nature's got me high and it's beautiful
    I'm with this deep eternal universe from death until rebirth

Chorus:
    This corner of the earth is like me in many ways
    I can sit for hours here and watch the emerald feathers splay
    On the face of it I'm blessed when the sunlight comes for free
    I know this corner of the earth, it smiles at me

Verse:
    So inspired of that there's nothing left to do or say
    Think I'll dream, 'til the stars shine
    The wind it whispers and the clouds don't seem to care
    And I know inside that it's all mine

Pre Chorus:
    It's the chorus of the breakin' dawn
    The mist that comes before the sun is born
    To a hazy afternoon in May
    
    Nature's got me high and it's so beautiful, yeah yeah
    I'm with this deep eternal universe from death until rebirth
