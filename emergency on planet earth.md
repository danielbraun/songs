Lyrics:

    The kids need education
    And the streets are never clean
    I've seen a certain disposition
    Prevailing in the wind
    Sweet change, if anybody's listening?
    Emergency on planet Earth
    Is that life that I am witnessing
    Or just another wasted birth?
    Now we got emergency
    We got emergency on planet Earth
    Now we got emergency
    We got emergency on planet Earth, just a head up
    Think we're standing for injustice
    White gets two and black gets five years
    Well it took me quite a while to suss this
    Now I know my head is cleared
    And a little boy in hungry land
    Is just a picture in the news
    I won't see him in the TV advertising
    Cause it might put you off your food
    Now we got emergency
    We got emergency on planet Earth
    Now we got emergency
    We got emergency on planet Earth, come on
    Is anybody out there?
    Is anybody out there?
    Is anybody out there?
    We got emergency on planet Earth, just a head up
    
    Is someone out there?
    Emergency on planet Earth is what we got
    What we got now
    Somebody help me
    Come on somebody help me now
    Come on somebody help us now
    I will need you
    Somebody help us now
    I will need you now
