....     Ending No, I'll never get used to

Oh, I don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go.
I guess she's got her reasons, but I just don't wanna know.
'Cause for twenty-four years I've been living next door to Alice.

Twenty-four years just waiting for a chance,
to tell her how I feel, and maybe get a second glance,
now I gotta get used to not living next door to Alice.
