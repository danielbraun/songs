Verse/Chorus:
	1 4   7 3
	6 2M7 5 5

....... At first I was afraid
....... And so you're back
....... Go on go, walk out the door
....... I will survive
....... Solo

....... It took all the strength I had
....... and you see me
....... Go on go walk out the door
....... I will survive
..      Pause
....... Go on go walk out the door
....... I will survive
