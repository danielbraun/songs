Verse I:
    Can you dig it? There's something in the air tonight
    Got a one way ticket, baby don't you wanna ride?
    Got to make it, make it to the other side
    I've got demons snapping at my heels tonight

Chorus:
    I just want to run away, Got people around running me down, I can't stay
    I just want to get away, Get them off my back today

Verse II:
    Can you feel it? I'm stuck inside a hurricane
    Chasing rainbows, can't you see I'm going insane?
    I wanna be a free man but I'm spinning on this crazy wheel
    I'm jumping for the high bar, can't you dig it? No longer know what I feel, can't you see?
